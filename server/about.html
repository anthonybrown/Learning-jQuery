            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a web developer and UI designer. Living north of Boston at the moment.
              I live with my wife of 12 years, we have a wonderful 10 year old son named,
              Jacob and also live with 2 dogs, 2 cats and a chinchilla.
            </p>
            <p>
              First I'd like to thank you for visiting my site. It's been a long time coming.
              I have been working with web technologies for the past, 5 years now and the more
              I learn, the more I want to learn and share what I've learned with the community.
              Hence, I've made several personal sites, I'd let the domain names run out and get
              caught up in making all sorts of things with the latest in tech. Like Nodejs and all
              the MV* frontend frameworks I was interested in. There is still so much I'm curious about
              and there is still so many use cases I need to learn and discover.
